## Graphs Go Up And Down

An economic simulation game. 

Four different commodities (or maybe currencies, or possibly just colours) go up and down over time. Spot patterns, trade wisely, make money.

Made using the [Wt framework](http://www.webtoolkit.eu/) (think Qt, but webbish). Almost everything in the /resources folder was taken straight from the Wt source, just replicated here for convenience.

All code here is available under GNU GPLv3.

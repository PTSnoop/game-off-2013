## Graphs Go Up And Down

An economic simulation game.

Nothing much to see here yet. I'm expecting this to be more of a teach-myself-the-wt-framework exercise than an actual thoroughly polished game - but who knows, maybe something playable will emerge.

Made using the [Wt framework](http://www.webtoolkit.eu/) (think Qt, but webbish). All code here is available under GNU GPLv3.
